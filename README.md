#     NumPy - First step in Data Analysis
> by Joana Santos Martins

#### What is Numpy?
NumPy stands for Numeric Python and is the fundamental library for scientific computing with Python. It is used to perform 
mathematical and statistical operations as well as data analysis. This free software package provides several features that allow 
the programmer to work with multidimensional arrays and matrices multiplication, thereby improving performance and execution. To use NumPy 
it is necessary to install the package in the system, through pip or Anaconda Python distribution. The code in this post was developed in 
Python 3.5 and NumPy, installed with the Anaconda. Code examples will be presented in Jupyter notebook. In this tutorial, we'll look at 
some examples of how the NumPy library can be used to perform a variety of tasks.
